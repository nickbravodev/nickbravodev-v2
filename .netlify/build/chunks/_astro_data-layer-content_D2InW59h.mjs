Working with the Figma design system created by their awesome UI/UX team, I completely rebuilt the Kum & Go public website from scratch within a tight deadline of four weeks, saving the company over $600,000 per year.","## Project Background\n\n<div class=\"hr-div\"></div>\n\nKum & Go was acquired by Maverik, one of the largest convenience store chains in the United States, in August 2023. During the following months, the two brands began to merge loyalty programs.\n\nIn February 2024, as contracts with vendors were sunsetting, we had a tight deadline to move the public website to the same internal server as maverik.com. I built the entire site with CMS integration in less than four weeks.\n\n## Cost v. Cost\n\n<div class=\"hr-div\"></div>\n\nThe original website was built using Next.js, React, and Contentful by two groups of contractors. They built the old website in 18 months, and the combined contractor fees and enterprise services cost the company over $1,000,000.\n\nOngoing maintenance, updates, and vendor contracts would cost over $600,000 annually. So, the company decided to eliminate the ongoing expenses and bring everything in-house.\n\n## A Fresh Perspective\n\n<div class=\"hr-div\"></div>\n\nI didn’t have access to the original codebase, so I worked with the UX/UI designers at Kum & Go to interpret the Figma design system and translate it to CSS within a fresh new codebase.\n\nThough the original website was built with Next.js, React, and Contentful, I built the new website using Astro, which I find to be faster and more user-friendly than Next.js in many ways. The original plan was to continue using Contentful for dynamic data, but the company ultimately decided to eliminate Contentful and use Astro Content Collections as the content management system. The site architecture changed, but the functionality remained the same.\n\nDespite the tight deadline, I rebuilt the website with full functionality and CMS integration using industry-standard practices, saving the company over $600,000 in annually recurring costs.","src/content/works/kum-and-go.mdx",[73],"./img/kng-hero.jpg","bb30302b05d14ec4","kum-and-go.mdx","sheriff-wood",{id:76,data:78,body:86,filePath:87,assetImports:88,digest:90,legacyId:91,deferredRender:18},{client:79,title:80,categories:81,featured:19,isDraft:19,image:82,date:83,tech:84,blurb:85},"Sherrif Wood","Sheriff campaign website.",[17],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./img/sheriff-wood-homepage-cover.png",["Date","2022-08-05T07:00:00.000Z"],"HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, Adobe CC","Campaign website for a sheriff election.

Building new pages and maintaining the site became too convoluted to continue. Since the Maverik and Kum & Go sites had a lot of duplicate content, we decided to build the new site using the same Astro framework and share a lot of components between the new sites.\n\nInstead of building new landing pages from scratch, we set up Astro Content Collections for more dynamic page building with automatic routing. We found a lot of areas to use Content Collections for dynamic content.\n\n## Design System\n\n<div class=\"hr-div\"></div>\n\nMaverik’s awesome UI/UX team built an awesome design system for the new site. Using Astro components, I integrated the design system into the site using Atomic Design principles. Now changes are easier, and we don’t have to worry about missing hidden elements.\n\nThe new design system features a light/dark mode toggle, respecting user’s system preferences by default, but giving them the option to switch anytime.\n\n## User Experience Upgrade\n\n<div class=\"hr-div\"></div>\n\nBy focusing on the user journey, and new site architecture built for improved functionality, users have noticed a much better user experience. The site is easier for users to navigate and for the marketing team to update.

blurb: Arcane Ops was a limited-run paranormal podcast that ran for seven episodes at the end of 2020. I designed the website layout in Adobe XD and built it using WordPress, WooCommerce, and Bootstrap. I designed the entire brand identity, including logos, social media images, video animations, and video thumbnails in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, AfterEffects, and Premiere.

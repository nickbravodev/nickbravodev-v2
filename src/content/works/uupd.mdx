blurb: In 2021, the University of Utah Department of Public Safety—which includes the Police Department, Campus Security, U Health Security, and Emergency Management—entered a new era of leadership that marked a turning point for the organization. With a renewed focus on safety, transparency, and community trust, the department needed a modern visual identity that embodied its mission and values. I was recruited to lead the full rebranding effort, guiding the process from research and discovery through design and implementation to deliver a cohesive brand system that now defines every touchpoint of public safety across campus.

## The Challenge

<div class="hr-div"></div>

<div class="my-4 mx-0 p-0 grid grid-cols-1 gap-4">
  <Image
    src={officers}
    alt="University of Utah Police Department officers with children at community event"
    class="round-corners"
  />
</div>

The department's existing identity no longer represented its evolving mission. The goal was to create a brand that projected professionalism, approachability, and trust for a diverse community of students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors—while also fostering pride and alignment within the department itself.

## My Role

<div class="hr-div"></div>

As lead designer, I managed every stage of the rebrand. Through extensive stakeholder interviews—from command staff to front-line officers—I gathered insights into the department's new vision and values. I then translated those findings into a comprehensive visual system that could adapt seamlessly across uniforms, vehicles, facilities, and digital platforms.

## The Process

<div class="hr-div"></div>

- Conducted discovery through interviews and workshops with leadership and staff

- Defined brand attributes centered on trust, professionalism, and approachability

- Designed a unified visual identity system, including logos, patches, and badges

- Applied the brand across vehicles, presentations, social media assets, signage, and merchandise

## Deliverables

<div class="hr-div"></div>

- A new University of Utah Department of Public Safety logo, now featured across all branding including wall signage, vehicles, badges, patches, flags, apparel, and promotional materials

</div>

- A redesigned shoulder patch for University Police Department uniforms

  />
  <Image
    src={patch3}
    alt="University of Utah Police Department uniform patch design"
    class="round-corners"
  />
</div>

- A new patrol car design for marked police vehicles (later adjusted for production due to budget considerations)

<div class="my-4 mx-0 p-0 grid grid-cols-1 grid-cols-md-3 gap-4">
  <Image
    src={patrolCar}
    alt="University of Utah Police Department patrol car design"
    class="round-corners"

  <Image
    src={patrolCarCloseUp}
    alt="University of Utah Police Department patrol car close-up design"

  />
  <Image
    src={emTrailer}
    alt="University of Utah Police Department emergency trailer design"
    class="round-corners"
  />
</div>

## The Outcome

<div class="hr-div"></div>

The rebrand established a strong, unified presence that clearly communicates the department's renewed mission and values. Today, whether it appears on a patrol car, a uniform, a presentation, or a digital platform, the University of Utah Department of Public Safety's new identity—and my design leadership—stand at the forefront of its public image.

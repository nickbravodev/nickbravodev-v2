blurb: In 2021, the University of Utah Police Department underwent a leadership transition that marked a turning point for the organization. With a renewed focus on safety, transparency, and community trust, the department needed a fresh identity that would embody its vision and values. I was brought in to lead the full rebranding effort, from research and discovery to design and implementation, creating a cohesive brand system that now defines every touchpoint of public safety across campus.

## The Challenge

<div class="hr-div"></div>

When new leadership took over, the department's existing visual identity no longer reflected its mission. The challenge was to design a brand that was professional, approachable, and trusted by a diverse community of students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors, while also earning buy-in from officers and leadership inside the department.

## My Role

<div class="hr-div"></div>

As lead designer, I oversaw the entire rebrand process. I conducted stakeholder interviews at every level, from command staff to front-line officers, to uncover the department's vision, then translated those insights into a unified design system that could scale across all mediums.

## The Process

<div class="hr-div"></div>

- Conducted discovery through interviews and workshops with leadership and staff

- Defined the department's brand attributes: trust, professionalism, approachability

- Designed a new visual identity system, including logos, patches, and badges

- Applied the brand across vehicle wraps, presentation materials, social media assets, signage, and merchandise

## The Outcome

<div class="hr-div"></div>

The rebrand delivered a strong, unified presence that communicates the department's renewed mission at every touchpoint. Today, whether it is a patrol car, an officer's uniform, a community presentation, or a digital asset, the University of Utah Police Department's updated identity and my design leadership are front and center.
